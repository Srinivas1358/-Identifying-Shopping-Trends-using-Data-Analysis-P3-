# Identifying-Shopping-Trends-using-Data-Analysis-P3

Shopping Trends Data Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes shopping trends based on historical data to identify patterns, preferences, and opportunities for businesses and retailers. The dataset includes information such as purchase history, customer demographics, product details, and transaction timestamps. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

Project Objectives
Data Collection: Acquired a dataset containing relevant shopping data (purchase history, customer demographics, etc.) in CSV format.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaned the data by handling missing values, converting data types, removing duplicates, and standardizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key data distributions, explored correlations, identified anomalies, and extracted insights.
Insights: Generated actionable insights that can help businesses improve marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer engagement.
Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
Cust ID: Customer ID associated with the order.
Gender: Gender of the customer (Male, Female).
Age: Age of the customer.
Age Group: Categorized age group (e.g., Young, Middle, Senior).
Date: Date of the purchase.
Month: Month in which the purchase was made.
Status: Order status (Delivered, Pending, etc.).
SKU: Product SKU (unique product identifier).
Category: Product category (e.g., Kurta, Set, Western Dress).
Size: Size of the product (e.g., M, L, XL).
Qty: Quantity of items purchased.
Amount: Total amount spent on the purchase.
Ship-City: City where the product was shipped.
Ship-State: State where the product was shipped.
Ship-Country: Country where the product was shipped.
B2B: Boolean indicating whether the order is B2B (Business to Business).
Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
Jupyter Notebooks: For running the project interactively (if applicable).
Steps Taken
1. Data Collection:
The dataset is in CSV format and contains information on customer orders.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handled missing or incomplete data.
Converted necessary columns into appropriate data types.
Removed duplicate records.
Standardized and normalized data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Various visualizations and analyses were performed, including:

Gender vs Amount Spent: Visualized which gender spends more.
Age Group vs Amount Spent: Analyzed the spending behavior across different age groups.
Category vs Amount Spent: Identified which product categories generate the most revenue.
Month-wise Sales: Explored sales trends across different months.
State and City-wise Analysis: Identified the top performing states and cities.
4. Key Insights:
Female customers have a higher spending power than male customers.
Middle-aged customers (26-45 years) contribute the most to revenue.
The Set and Kurta categories are the most popular and revenue-generating products.
Most orders are shipped to customers in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.
